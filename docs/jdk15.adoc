== New Features in JDK 15
:sourcedir: ../src/main/java/net/bakaar/jdk/demo

=== Text Blocks

* added in jdk 13
* express a multiline String
* take attention of the position of final `"""`, the last carriage return count
* consider only space after the first character of the first line BUT the closing delimiter can change that if you put it before the first character.
* you can use `"` and `""` inside the text block
* you can use `"""` inside a text block by escaping the at least one `"` (ex: `\"""`)
* you can add text block by using `+`

Example code with String :

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/TextBlock.java[lines=6..10]
----

Example code with TextBlock :

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/TextBlock.java[lines=15..21]
----

==== NOTES

* IntelliJ show the final indentation
* More examples here : https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/378

=== Records (second preview)

* added in jdk 14
* Data class => immutable
* add possibility to declare a record locally
* allow annotation on fields in the constructor
* can override automatically generated method
* can add new methods

Example :

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/Person.java[lines=6..11]
----

=== Pattern Matching instanceof (second preview)

* added in jdk 14
* direct cast (remove the need of an explicit cast after the `if` statement)

Code example before :

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/PatternMatchingInstanceOf.java[lines=6..9]
----

Code example after :

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/PatternMatchingInstanceOf.java[lines=13..15]
----

==== NOTES

* Valid only in the `true` block of an `if else` declaration

=== Sealed Types (preview)

* prevent class extension but not superclass usage
* extension is limited to a bunch of selected/declared classes
* works for interfaces too

Base Class :

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/hidden/Shape.java[lines=3..7]
----

Extending Class :

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{sourcedir}/hidden/Circle.java[lines=4..5]
----

==== NOTES

* the extending class need to be final (logical !)
