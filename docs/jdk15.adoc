== New Features in JDK 15

=== Text Blocks

* added in jdk 13
* express a multiline String
* take attention of the position of final `"""`, the last carriage return count
* consider only space after the first character of the first line BUT the closing delimiter can change that if you put it before the first character.
* you can use `"` and `""` inside the text block
* you can use `"""` inside a text block by escaping the at least one `"` (ex: `\"""`)
* you can add text block by using `+`
